the main routine will open the generator list txt file, and for each tuple:
	it opens the mcoef list txt file, and for each tuple:
		it calculates m, and decides if it is worth checking a covering (consult a lower bound?)
			if it is, it then checks the covering for m, recording as necessary.
				open xcoef table, and for each tuple:
					while greater than m
						subtract m
					check 2nd place, borrow as needed, record
					check 3rd place, borrow as needed, record
					mark m
				check to see if every x in the range has been hit, record
					if it has been covered, print out the relevant data to file
